Kick'n'Pick'em

README 
Kick'n'Pick'em is a web app which allows users to search a database of footballers(soccer) and display them on their team. When an player is searched via the Add Players tab, a card is displayed that shows that player with the option to add the player. When a user wants to view their team, they can find all the players they have added on the Team page. When a user would like to remove a player from their team, the user can remove the player on their team page by clicking the remove button at the botom of the player card. 

Both within the Add Player and Team tabs, the user can see information about the player, including club and nationality, as well as two photos of the player. 

Kick'n'Pick'em uses the database https://www.thesportsdb.com/. Thanks https://www.thesportsdb.com/, we couldn't do it without you! 

The project is also built on the back of React, and uses Fomantic UI styling. Thanks to both React and Fomantic teams!
